## Overview

Kibitz is a local developer tool (VS Code extension + CLI). It is designed to process session data on your machine.

## Data We Process

Kibitz may process:

- Terminal session metadata (session IDs, names, provider type).
- Prompt text you send through Kibitz dispatch.
- Status events related to dispatch (`queued`, `started`, `sent`, `failed`).
- Local diagnostic logs generated by the extension/CLI.

## Data Storage

- Data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly share it.
- Kibitz does not require a hosted Kibitz account to function.
- Kibitz does not sell personal data.

## Third-Party Services

- Kibitz interacts with third-party tools you install and authenticate separately (for example, Claude/Codex CLIs, GitHub).
- Their data handling is governed by their own policies.

## Security

- You are responsible for securing your machine, terminal history, and workspace files.
- Avoid sending secrets in prompts unless your local environment is secured.

## Your Choices

- You can stop using Kibitz at any time.
- You can remove local logs/history by deleting local extension/CLI data on your machine.
